# Geolocation Practice 

This exercise was provided at Ironhack on week 5.
I used google geolocation API to create a mock google map.
JavaScript files are separated into two files: for the main functions and for call back functions. 

## Features
- Current location finder. Click a button and it will show an approximate current location in the map.
- By entering Latitude and Longitude, a map centering the specific location will appear. 
- By entering City name, a map centering the specific city will appear.
